In general most of the input data fits with scalar data types, but some times we have to deal with complex input data sets like

(3,8,9) (4,5,6)
(1,4,7) (3,7,5)
(2,5,8) (9,5,8)

mydata = LOAD '/pig/data' AS (col1:tuple(n11:int, n12:int,n13:int),col2:tuple(n21:int,t22:int,t23:int));
projdata = foreach mydata generate col1.n11 as num1, col2.n21 as num2;


Base ball data example
a sample record is:

Jorge Posada    New York Yankees        {(Catcher),(Designated_hitter)} [games#1594,hit_by_pitch#65,on_base_percentage#0.379,grand_slams#7,home_runs#243,at_bats#5365,sacrifice_flies#43,gdb#163,sacrifice_hits#1,ibbs#71,base_on_balls#838,hits#1488,rbis#964,slugging_percentage#0.48,batting_average#0.277,triples#9,doubles#342,strikeouts#1278,runs#817]

baseball = load '/pig/baseball' as (name:chararray, team:chararray, postition:bag{t:(p:chararray)}, bat:map[]);
mydata = foreach baseball generate name, bat#'base_on_balls' - bat#'ibbs'
